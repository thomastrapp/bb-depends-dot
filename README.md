BitBake Recipe Dependencies
===========================

List recipes from Bitbake's `task-depends.dot` and the dependencies
between these recipes.

Example:

```shell
# generate `task-depends.dot`
bitbake -g foo

# list recipes with at least one task that recipe "curl" depends on directly
bb-recipe-depend task-depends.dot curl

# list recipes that have at least one task that directly depends on a task
# from recipe "curl":
bb-recipe-depend task-depends.dot -r curl

# list recipes with at least one task that recipe "curl" depends on, and list
# all their dependencies
bb-recipe-depend task-depends.dot -t curl
```

Options:

```
./bb-recipe-depend - List dependencies between BitBake recipes.

Usage:
  ./bb-recipe-depend [options] <task-depends.dot>
      List all recipes

  ./bb-recipe-depend [options] <task-depends.dot> <recipe_name>
      List dependencies of a specific recipe

Options:
  --task-depends-dot <file> The task-depends.dot file generated by `bitbake -g`
  --recipe <recipe_name>    Select a recipe
  -d [ --depends ]          List dependencies of recipe (default if recipe 
                            given)
  -r [ --rdepends ]         List reverse dependencies of recipe
  -t [ --transitive ]       List all transitive dependencies of the given 
                            recipe
  -h [ --help ]             Print this help message
  -V [ --version ]          Print version
```

Dependencies:

* Linux-based OS
* A compiler with `C++17` support, such as `g++` ≥7 or  `clang++` ≥5
* `cmake` ≥3.10
* `libboost-dev`
* `libboost-graph-dev`
* `libboost-program-options-dev`

Build and install:

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

**Note**: The DOT parser is very simplistic - It won't parse any DOT files
properly, but the output of `bitbake -g`.
